# INTERNSHIP_PROJECTS
This project classifies handwritten digits (0-9) using the `load_digits` dataset from `sklearn.datasets`. We visualize, preprocess (reshape and normalize), and split the data into training and testing sets. A RandomForestClassifier is trained and evaluated, demonstrating high accuracy in predicting handwritten digits on the test set.
